# THE SNAKE AND LADDER GAME

This is a python code for the game snakes and ladders.
Since it is my first time coding a game (without graphics), it would be really helpfull if you check the code and think of alternate ways of doing it.
If you do have a alternative way please send a PR or just personally text me.
Lastly if you have knowledge related to graphic work please suggest a learning path for me so that i can implement graphics in this game 
Thank you
